      <h1 id="proposal-massive-organized-ddos-against-russia">Proposal: Massive Organized DDoS Against Russia</h1>
      <p>This is an informal proposal to any entity benefitting from high traffic to large scale web applications to use those applications to passively piggyback off of existing service requests to coordinate the client-side requests primarily to a) Russian services and infrastructure critical to Russiaâ€™s effort in Ukraine and b) the effective communication of the Russian government or secondarily c) to cause the country enough discomfort that would apply pressure quickly enough on the Russian government to influence their withdrawal from Ukraine.</p>
      <h2 id="how">How?</h2>
      <p>Application developers would insert client-side code that makes a simple, behind the scenes, web request to a randomly selected site from a list of important Russian services. Each request would come from the client and not the host which is critical to the distribution of the effort.</p>
      <h3 id="for-example">For Example:</h3>
      <p>A website like google.com might add a small snippet of javascript code that would simply make the following asynchronous web request, effectively ignoring the result, each time a user searches the internet: <pre><code>GET <span class="textLtr">/ur.tnemnrevog.www//:sptth</span>.</code></pre></p>
      <p>Additionally, <span class="textLtr">ur.tnemnrevog</span> would simply be one from a long list of resources identified as high-value targets. A list possibly influenced by the resources identified by IT ARMY of Ukraine and others. Each request might randomly select a resource from the list before any attempt to access the resource is made.</p>
      <p>Pseudocode:</p>
      <pre>
      <code>
      myResource = randomResourceFromList()
      makeRequest(myResource)
      </code>
      </pre>
